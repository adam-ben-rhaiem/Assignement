It is an assignement of Training a classifier to predict the class: 0 or 1.

in this Assignement we compare 3 differenet models 
1-Random Forest Classifier:

Random Decision Forest is a supervised Machine learning algorithm used for classification, regression, and other tasks using decision trees.

2-K-Nearest Neighbor:

The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a supervised machine learning method employed to tackle classification and regression problem

3-Logistic Regression:

Logistic regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm widely used for binary classification tasks.


Using F1 score as evaluation metric:

F1 score is a measure of the harmonic mean of precision and recall. Commonly used as an evaluation metric in binary and multi-class classification and LLM evaluation, the F1 score integrates precision and recall into a single metric to gain a better understanding of model performance.
