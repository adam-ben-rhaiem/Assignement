It is an assignement of Training a classifier to predict the class: 0 or 1.

in this Assignement we compare 3 differenet models 

__1-Random Forest Classifier:__

Random Decision Forest is a supervised Machine learning algorithm used for classification, regression, and other tasks using decision trees.

__2-K-Nearest Neighbor:__

The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a supervised machine learning method employed to tackle classification and regression problem

__3-Logistic Regression:__

Logistic regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm widely used for binary classification tasks.


__Using F1 score as evaluation metric:__

F1 score is a measure of the harmonic mean of precision and recall. Commonly used as an evaluation metric in binary and multi-class classification and LLM evaluation, the F1 score integrates precision and recall into a single metric to gain a better understanding of model performance.  

Data Pre-Processing

__Results__

the comparison between the 3 models have shown the best performance related to Random Forest Classifier with F1-scoere=0.96
and then we get F1-score=0.93 when using Logisitic Regression Model.The pporest Performance among the Three models was K-Neares Neighbors with F1-score=0.83
